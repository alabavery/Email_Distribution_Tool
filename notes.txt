-------------------- PROJECT DESCRIPTION ------------------------
This bot would be working with an Excel spreadsheet, or an Access database if necessary. 
The spreadsheet is a list of addresses with a couple of fields that are marked empty or 1. 
The bot would upon receiving an email (or form submission or whatever works best: A. search the addresses for those that have both fields marked 1. 
B. choose 10 of them. 
C. reply to the request with those 10 addresses. 
D. do this for multiple requests without repeating addresses. 
E. upon receiving a photograph of postcards (probably just recognizing the file type, not getting into photo recognition) from someone who has already received 10 addresses, would generate 10 more.


-------------------- OUTSTANDING QUESTIONS ------------------------
1. What do to when address has received all of addresses from both fields and one field?
2. What does 'generate' a new address mean?  How is this different than just sending address?
3. What action to take if someone who has not yet received any addresses sends postcard?
4. Ballpark estimate of emails it will need to receive/send?
5. Will it always be run on Windows?

-------------------- GENERAL NOTES --------------------------------
- To execute index.py, had to add shebang, run command chmod a+x index.py, and use the command ./index.py rather than index.py
- If you use config.py file, will need to make sure it's in there...
- Need to make sure that client_secret.json makes it to user
